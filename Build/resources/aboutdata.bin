LINEAR EQUATION#A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term~is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the~first power of) a single variable.~~Linear equations can have one or more variables. Linear~equations occur abundantly in most subareas of mathematics and~especially in applied mathematics. While they arise quite~naturally when modeling many phenomena, they are particularly~useful since many non-linear equations may be reduced to linear~equations by assuming that quantities of interest vary to only~a small extent from some "background" state. Linear equations~do not include exponents.~~This article considers the case of a single equation for which~one searches the real solutions. All its content applies for~complex solutions and, more generally for linear equations with~coefficients and solutions in any field. For coefficients and~solutions in an integral domain, see Linear equation over a~ring.~~In mathematics, a system of linear equations (or linear system)~is a collection of linear equations involving the same set of~variables. For example,~~3x + 2y - z = 1~2x - 2y + 4z = -2~-x + `171`y - z = 0~~is a system of three equations in the three variables x, y, z.~A solution to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to~the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously~satisfied. A solution to the system above is given by~~x = 1~y = -2~z = -2~~since it makes all three equations valid. The word "system"~indicates that the equations are to be considered collectively,~rather than individually.|System of linear equations:-~=============================~~General form:-~+++++++++++++++~A general system of m linear equations with n unknowns can be~written as~~a11x1 + a12x2 + .... + a1nxn = b1~a21x1 + a22x2 + .... + a2nxn = b2~  .       .              .     .~  .       .              .     .~  .       .              .     .~am1x1 + am2x2 + .... + amnxn = bm~~Here x1,x2,....,xn are the unknowns, a11,a12,...,amn are the~coefficients of the system, and b1,b2,....,bn are the~constant terms.~~Often the coefficients and unknowns are real or complex~numbers, but integers and rational numbers are also seen, as~are polynomials and elements of an abstract algebraic~structure.~~Matrix equation:-~------------------~~Ax = b~~where A is an m×n matrix, x is a column vector with n~entries, and b is a column vector with m entries.~~A = `179` a11 a12 ... a1n `179`  x = `179` x1 `179`  b = `179` b1 `179`~    `179` a21 a22 ... a2n `179`      `179` x2 `179`      `179` b2 `179`~    `179`  .   .  ...  .  `179`      `179` .  `179`      `179` .  `179`~    `179`  .   .  ...  .  `179`      `179` .  `179`      `179` .  `179`~    `179` a21 a22 ... a2n `179`      `179` xn `179`      `179` bm `179`~~The number of vectors in a basis for the span is now~expressed as the rank of the matrix.~~Linear equations in two variables:-~====================================~A common form of a linear equation in the two variables x and y is~~y = mx + b~~where m and b designate constants (parameters). The origin of~the name "linear" comes from the fact that the set of solutions~of such an equation forms a straight line in the plane. In this~particular equation, the constant m determines the slope or~gradient of that line, and the constant term b determines the~point at which the line crosses the y-axis, otherwise known as~the y-intercept.~~Forms for 2-D linear equations:-~+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++~~General (or standard) form:-~-----------------------------~In the general (or standard[1]) form the linear equation is~written as:~~Ax + By = C~~where A and B are not both equal to zero. The equation is~usually written so that A & 0, by convention. The graph of the~equation is a straight line, and every straight line can be~represented by an equation in the above form. If A is nonzero,~then the x-intercept, that is, the x-coordinate of the point~where the graph crosses the x-axis (where, y is zero), is C/A.~~If B is nonzero, then the y-intercept, that is the y-~coordinate of the point where the graph crosses the y-axis ~(where x is zero), is C/B, and the slope of the line is A/B.~The general form is sometimes written as:~~ax + by + c = 0~~where a and b are not both equal to zero.~The two versions can be converted from one to the other by ~moving the constant term to the other side of the equal sign.~~Slope-intercept form:-~-----------------------~y = mx + b~~where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept,~which is the y-coordinate of the location where line crosses~the y axis. This can be seen by letting x = 0, which~immediately gives y = b. It may be helpful to think about~this in terms of y = b + mx; where the line passes through~the point (0, b) and extends to the left and right at a slope~of m. Vertical lines, having undefined slope, cannot be~represented by this form.~~Point-slope form:-~-------------------~y-y1 = m(x-x1)~~where m is the slope of the line and (x1,y1) is any point on~the line.~~The point-slope form expresses the fact that the difference~in the y coordinate between two points on a line (that is, y-~y1) is proportional to the difference in the x coordinate~(that is, x-x1). The proportionality constant is m (the slope~of the line).~~Two-point form:-~-----------------~y-y1 = {(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)}(x-x1)~~where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line with~x2-x1. This is equivalent to the point-slope form above,~where the slope is explicitly given as (y2-y1)/(x2-x1).~~Intercept form:-~-----------------~x/a + y/b = 1~~where a and b must be nonzero. The graph of the equation has~x-intercept a and y-intercept b. The intercept form is in~standard form with A/C = 1/a and B/C = 1/b. Lines that pass~through the origin or which are horizontal or vertical~violate the nonzero condition on a or b and cannot be~represented in this form.~~Parametric form:-~------------------~x = Tt + U~~and~~y = Vt + W~~Two simultaneous equations in terms of a variable parameter~t, with slope m = V / T, x-intercept (VU - WT) / V and y-~intercept (WT - VU) / T. This can also be related to the two-~point form, where T = p - h, U = h, V = q - k, and W = k:~This can also be related to the two-point form, where T = p -~ h, U = h, V = q - k, and W = k:~~x = (p - h)t + h~~and~~y = (q - k)t + k~~In this case t varies from 0 at point (h,k) to 1 at point~(p,q), with values of t between 0 and 1 providing~interpolation and other values of t providing extrapolation.~~Matrix form:-~--------------~Using the order of the standard form~~Ax + By = C~~one can rewrite the equation in matrix form:~~`179` A B `179` `179` x `179` = `179` C `179`~        `179` y `179`~~Further, this representation extends to systems of linear equations.~~A1x + B1y = C1~A2x + B2y = C2~~becomes~~`179` A1 B1 `179` `179` x `179` = `179` C1 `179`~`179` A2 B2 `179` `179` y `179` = `179` C2 `179`~~Since this extends easily to higher dimensions, it is a~common representation in linear algebra, and in computer~programming. There are named methods for solving system of~linear equations, like Gauss-Jordan which can be expressed as ~matrix elementary row operations.|No Info. available here, please view other sections to get information.|http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LinearEquation.html
HEXAGON#In geometry, a hexagon is a polygon with six edges and six vertices. A regular hexagon has Schlafli symbol {6}. The total of the internal angles of any hexagon is 720`248`.~~Hexagonal structures:-~=======================~From bees' honeycombs to the Giant's Causeway, hexagonal patterns are prevalent in nature due to their efficiency. In a hexagonal grid each line is as short as it can possibly be if a large area is to be filled with the fewest number of hexagons. This means that honeycombs require less wax to construct and gain lots of strength under compression.~~Regular hexagon:-~==================~A regular hexagon has all sides of the same length, and all internal angles are 120 degrees. A regular hexagon has 6 rotational symmetries (rotational symmetry of order six) and 6 reflection symmetries (six lines of symmetry), making up the dihedral group D6. The longest diagonals of a regular hexagon, connecting diametrically opposite vertices, are twice the length of one side. From this it can be seen that a triangle with a vertex at the center of the regular hexagon and sharing one side with the hexagon is equilateral, and that the regular hexagon can be partitioned into six equilateral triangles.~~Like squares and equilateral triangles, regular hexagons fit together without any gaps to tile the plane (three hexagons meeting at every vertex), and so are useful for constructing tessellations. The cells of a beehive honeycomb are hexagonal for this reason and because the shape makes efficient use of space and building materials. The Voronoi diagram of a regular triangular lattice is the honeycomb tessellation of hexagons. It is not usually considered a triambus, although it is equilateral.|Cyclic hexagon:-~=================~A cyclic hexagon is any hexagon inscribed in a circle. If the successive sides of the cyclic hexagon are a, b, c, d, e, f, then the three main diagonals intersect in a single point if and only if ace = bdf.~~Hexagon inscribed in a conic section:-~=======================================~Pascal's theorem (also known as the "Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem") states that if an arbitrary hexagon is inscribed in any conic section, and pairs of opposite sides are extended until they meet, the three intersection points will lie on a straight line, the "Pascal line" of that configuration.~~Hexagon tangential to a conic section:-~========================================~Let ABCDEF be a hexagon formed by six tangent lines of a conic section. Then Brianchon's theorem states that the three main diagonals AD, BE, and CF intersect at a single point.~In a hexagon that is tangential to a circle and that has consecutive sides a, b, c, d, e, and f,~~a + c + e = b + d + f|The area of a regular hexagon of side length t is given by~~A `247` (2.598076211)t`253`~~An alternative formula for area is A = 1.5dt where the length d is the distance between the parallel sides (also referred to as the flat-to-flat distance), or the height of the hexagon when it sits on one side as base, or the diameter of the inscribed circle.~~Another alternative formula for the area if only the flat-to-flat distance, d, is known, is given by~~A `247` (0.866025404)d`253`~~The area can also be found by the formulas~~A = (ap)/2~~A `247` (3.464102)a`253`~~where a is the apothem and p is the perimeter.~~The perimeter of a regular hexagon of side length t is 6t, its maximal diameter 2t, and its minimal diameter ~~d = (`251`3)t~~If a regular hexagon has successive vertices A, B, C, D, E, F and if P is any point on the circumscribing circle between B and C, then PE + PF = PA + PB + PC + PD.~|http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hexagon.html
PENTAGON#In geometry, a pentagon (from pente, which is Greek for the number 5) is any five-sided polygon. A pentagon may be simple or self-intersecting. The sum of the internal angles in a simple pentagon is 540°. A pentagram is an example of a self-intersecting pentagon.~~|Construction of a regular pentagon:-~=====================================~~Euclid's methods:-~+++++++++++++++++++~A regular pentagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge, either by inscribing one in a given circle or constructing one on a given edge. This process was described by Euclid in his Elements circa 300 BC.~~Richmond's method:-~++++++++++++++++++++~One method to construct a regular pentagon in a given circle is described by Richmond and further discussed in Cromwell's "Polyhedra."~~Verification:-~---------------------~~1.Draw a circle in which to inscribe the pentagon and mark the center point O. (This is the green circle in the diagram to the right).~~2.Choose a point A on the circle that will serve as one vertex of the pentagon. Draw a line through O and A.~~3.Construct a line perpendicular to the line OA passing through O. Mark its intersection with one side of the circle as the point B.~~4.Construct the point C as the midpoint of the line OB.~~5.Draw a circle centered at C through the point A. Mark its intersection with the line OB (inside the original circle) as the point D.~~6.Draw a circle centered at A through the point D. Mark its intersections with the original (green) circle as the points E and F.~~7.Draw a circle centered at E through the point A. Mark its other intersection with the original circle as the point G.~~8.Draw a circle centered at F through the point A. Mark its other intersection with the original circle as the point H.~~9.Construct the regular pentagon AEGHF.~~Simple methods:-~+++++++++++++++++~~A regular pentagon may be created from just a strip of paper by tying an overhand knot into the strip and carefully flattening the knot by pulling the ends of the paper strip. Folding one of the ends back over the pentagon will reveal a pentagram when backlit.~~Construct a regular hexagon on stiff paper or card. Crease along the three diameters between opposite vertices. Cut from one vertex to the center to make an equilateral triangular flap. Fix this flap underneath its neighbor to make a pentagonal pyramid. The base of the pyramid is a regular pentagon.|Regular pentagons:-~====================~In a regular pentagon, all sides are equal in length and each interior angle is 108`248`. A regular pentagon has five lines of reflectional symmetry, and rotational symmetry of order 5 (through 72`248`, 144`248`, 216`248` and 288`248`). Its Schlafli symbol is {5}. The diagonals of a regular pentagon are in golden ratio to its sides.~~The area of a regular convex pentagon with side length t is given by~~A = {(t`253`)(`251`[25+10`251`(5)])}/4~~A `247` (1.720477401)t`253`~~A pentagram or pentangle is a regular star pentagon. Its Schlafli symbol is {5/2}. Its sides form the diagonals of a regular convex pentagon – in this arrangement the sides of the two pentagons are in the golden ratio.~~When a regular pentagon is inscribed in a circle with radius R, its edge length t is given by the expression~~t = R`251`[{5-`251`(5)}/2] `247` (1.17557050458)R~|http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Pentagon.html
TRIANGLE#A triangle is one of the basic shapes in geometry: a polygon~with three corners or vertices and three sides or edges which~are line segments. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is~denoted `30` ABC.~~In Euclidean geometry any three points, when non-collinear,~determine a unique triangle and a unique plane (i.e. a ~two-dimensional Euclidean space).~~Types of triangle:-~====================~~By relative lengths of sides:-~+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++~~Triangles can be classified according to the relative lengths of their sides:~~1. In an equilateral triangle all sides have the same length. An~equilateral triangle is also a regular polygon with all angles~measuring 60`248`.~~2. In an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal in length. An~isosceles triangle also has two angles of the same measure;~namely, the angles opposite to the two sides of the same~length; this fact is the content of the isosceles triangle~theorem, which was known by Euclid. Some mathematicians define an isosceles triangle to have exactly two equal sides, whereas others define~an isosceles triangle as one with at least two equal sides. The latter definition would make all equilateral triangles isosceles triangles. The 45-45-90 right triangle, which appears in the tetrakis square tiling, is isosceles.~~3. In a scalene triangle, all sides are unequal, and~equivalently all angles are unequal. Right triangles are~scalene if and only if not isosceles.~~By internal angles:-~+++++++++++++++++++++~~Triangles can also be classified according to their internal angles (measured here in degrees):-~~1. A right triangle (or right-angled triangle, formerly~called a rectangled triangle) has one of its interior angles measuring 90`248` (a right angle). The side opposite to the right angle is the hypotenuse; it is the longest side of the right triangle. The other two sides~are called the legs or catheti (singular: cathetus) of the triangle. Right triangles obey the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse: ~~a`253` + b`253` = c`253` ~~where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length~of the hypotenuse. Special right triangles are right~triangles with additional properties that make calculations~involving them easier. One of the two most famous is the ~3-4-5 right triangle, where 3`253` + 4`253` = 5`253`. In this~situation, 3, 4, and 5 are a Pythagorean triple. The other~one is an isosceles triangle that has 2 angles that each~measure 45 degrees.~~2. Triangles that do not have an angle that measures 90`248` are called oblique triangles.~~3. A triangle that has all interior angles measuring less~than 90`248` is an acute triangle or acute-angled triangle. If the greatest side length is c, then a`253` + b`253` > c`253`.~~4. A triangle that has one interior angle that measures more~than 90`248` is an obtuse triangle or obtuse-angled triangle. If the greatest side length is c, then a`253` + b`253` < c`253`.~~5. A "triangle" with an interior angle of 180`248` (and collinear vertices) is degenerate.~~6. A right degenerate triangle has collinear vertices, two of~which are coincident.~|Triangles are assumed to be two-dimensional plane figures, unless the context provides otherwise (see Non-planar triangles, below). In rigorous treatments, a triangle is therefore called a 2-simplex (see also Polytope). Elementary facts about triangles were presented by Euclid in books 1-4 of his Elements, around 300 BC.~~~The measures of the interior angles of the triangle always add up to 180 degrees (same color to point out they are equal).~The measures of the interior angles of a triangle in Euclidean space always add up to 180 degrees. This allows determination of the measure of the third angle of any triangle given the measure of two angles. An exterior angle of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it; this is the exterior angle theorem. The sum of the measures of the three exterior angles (one for each vertex) of any triangle is 360 degrees.~~Similarity and congruence:-~============================~~Two triangles are said to be similar if every angle of one triangle has the same measure as the corresponding angle in the other triangle. The corresponding sides of similar triangles have lengths that are in the same proportion, and this property is also sufficient to establish similarity.~A few basic theorems about similar triangles:~~1. If two corresponding internal angles of two triangles have the same measure, the triangles are similar.~~2. If two corresponding sides of two triangles are in proportion, and their included angles have the same measure, then the triangles are similar. (The included angle for any two sides of a polygon is the internal angle between those two sides.)~~3. If three corresponding sides of two triangles are in proportion, then the triangles are similar.~~Two triangles that are congruent have exactly the same size and shape: all pairs of corresponding interior angles are equal in measure, and all pairs of corresponding sides have the same length. (This is a total of six equalities, but three are often sufficient to prove congruence.)~~Some sufficient conditions for a pair of triangles to be congruent are:+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++~SAS Postulate: Two sides in a triangle have the same length as two sides in the other triangle, and the included angles have the same measure.~~ASA: Two interior angles and the included side in a triangle have the same measure and length, respectively, as those in the other triangle. (The included side for a pair of angles is the side that is common to them.)~~SSS: Each side of a triangle has the same length as a corresponding side of the other triangle.~~AAS: Two angles and a corresponding (non-included) side in a triangle have the same measure and length, respectively, as those in the other triangle. (This is sometimes referred to as AAcorrS and then includes ASA above.)~~Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) Theorem: The hypotenuse and a leg in a right triangle have the same length as those in another right triangle. This is also called RHS (right-angle, hypotenuse, side).~~Hypotenuse-Angle Theorem: The hypotenuse and an acute angle in one right triangle have the same length and measure, respectively, as those in the other right triangle. This is just a particular case of the AAS theorem.~~An important case:~~Side-Side-Angle (or Angle-Side-Side) condition: If two sides and a corresponding non-included angle of a triangle have the same length and measure, respectively, as those in another triangle, then this is not sufficient to prove congruence; but if the angle given is opposite to the longer side of the two sides, then the triangles are congruent. The Hypotenuse-Leg Theorem is a particular case of this criterion. The Side-Side-Angle condition does not by itself guarantee that the triangles are congruent because one triangle could be obtuse-angled and the other acute-angled.~~Using right triangles and the concept of similarity, the trigonometric functions sine and cosine can be defined. These are functions of an angle which are investigated in trigonometry.~~Existence of a triangle:-~++++++++++++++++++++++++++~~The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side, a principle known as the triangle inequality. Since the vertices of a triangle are assumed to be non-collinear, it is not possible for the sum of the length of two sides be equal to the length of the third side; nor is it possible for that sum to be less than the length of the third side.~~Trigonometric conditions:-~---------------------------~~Three positive angles `224`, `225`, and `231`, each of them less than 180`248`, are the angles of a triangle if and only if any one of the following conditions holds:~~tan(`224`/2)tan(`225`/2) + tan(`225`/2)tan(`231`/2) + tan(`231`/2)tan(`224`/2) = 1~~sin`253`(`224`/2) + sin`253`(`225`/2) + sin`253`(`231`/2) + 2sin(`224`/2)sin(`225`/2)sin(`231`/2) = 1~|Sine, cosine and tangent rules:-~=================================~~The law of sines, or sine rule, states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its corresponding opposite angle is constant, that is~~a/sin(`224`) = b/sin(`225`) = c/sin(`231`)~~This ratio is equal to the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the given triangle. Another interpretation of this theorem is that every triangle with angles `224`, `225` and `231` is similar to a triangle with side lengths equal to sin(`224`), sin(`225`) and sin(`231`). This triangle can be constructed by first constructing a circle of diameter 1, and inscribing in it two of the angles of the triangle. The length of the sides of that triangle will be sin(`224`), sin(`225`) and sin(`231`). The side whose length is sin(`224`) is opposite to the angle whose measure is (`224`), etc.~~The law of cosines, or cosine rule, connects the length of an unknown side of a triangle to the length of the other sides and the angle opposite to the unknown side. As per the law:~For a triangle with length of sides a, b, c and angles of `224`, `225` and `231` respectively, given two known lengths of a triangle a and b, and the angle between the two known sides `231` (or the angle opposite to the unknown side c), to calculate the third side c, the following formula can be used:~~c`253` = a`253` + b`253` -2abcos(`231`)~~b`253` = a`253` + c`253` -2accos(`225`)~~a`253` = b`253` + c`253` -2bccos(`224`)~~The law of tangents or tangent rule, can be used to find a side or an angle when you know two sides and an angle or two angles and a side. It states that:~~(a - b)/(a + b) = tan[{`171`(`224`-`225`)}/{`171`(`224`+`225`)}]~~Computing the area of a triangle:-~===================================~~Calculating the area T of a triangle is an elementary problem encountered often in many different situations. The best known and simplest formula is:~~T = `171`(bh)~~where b is the length of the base of the triangle, and h is the height or altitude of the triangle. The term "base" denotes any side, and "height" denotes the length of a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the side onto the line containing the side itself. In 499 CE Aryabhata, a great mathematician-astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy, used this method in the Aryabhatiya (section 2.6).|http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/Triangles.html
QUADRATIC EQUATION#In elementary algebra, a quadratic equation (from the Latin quadratus for "square") is any equation having the form~~ax`253` + bx + c = 0~~where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c are constants with a not equal to 0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic. The constants a, b, and c are called, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term.~~Because the quadratic equation involves only one unknown, it is called "univariate". The quadratic equation only contains powers of x that are non-negative integers, and therefore it is a polynomial equation, and in particular it is a second degree polynomial equation since the greatest power is two.|Solving the quadratic equation:-~=================================~~A quadratic equation with real or complex coefficients has two solutions, called roots. These two solutions may or may not be distinct, and they may or may not be real.~~Factoring by inspection:-~++++++++++++++++++++++++++~~It may be possible to express a quadratic equation, ax`253` + bx + c = 0 as a product (px + q)(rx + s) = 0. In some cases, it is possible, by simple inspection, to determine values of p, q, r, and s that make the two forms equivalent to one another. If the quadratic equation is written in the second form, then the "Zero Factor Property" states that the quadratic equation is satisfied if px + q = 0 or rx + s = 0. Solving these two linear equations provides the roots of the quadratic.~~For most students, factoring by inspection is the first method of solving quadratic equations to which they are exposed. If one is given a quadratic equation in the form x2 + px + q = 0, one would seek to find two numbers that add up to p and whose product is q ("Vieta's Rule"). The more general case where a does not equal 1 can require a considerable effort in trial and error guess-and-check, assuming that it can be factored at all by inspection.~~Except for special cases such as where b = 0 or c = 0, factoring by inspection only works for quadratic equations that have rational roots. This means that the great majority of quadratic equations that arise in practical applications cannot be solved by factoring by inspection.~~Completing the square:-~++++++++++++++++++++++++~~The process of completing the square makes use of the algebraic identity~~x`253` + 2xh + h`253` = (x+h)`253`,~~which represents a well-defined algorithm that can be used to solve any quadratic equation. Starting with a quadratic equation in standard form, ax`253` + bx + c = 0~~Divide each side by a, the coefficient of the squared term.~Rearrange the equation so that the constant term c/a is on the right side.~~Add the square of one-half of b/a, the coefficient of x, to both sides. This "completes the square", converting the left side into a perfect square.~~Write the left side as a square and simplify the right side if necessary.~~Produce two linear equations by equating the square root of the left side with the positive and negative square roots of the right side.~~Solve the two linear equations.~~|Quadratic formula and its derivation:-~=======================================~~Completing the square can be used to derive a general formula for solving quadratic equations, called the quadratic formula.  The mathematical proof will now be briefly summarized.[4] It can easily be seen, by polynomial expansion, that the following equation is equivalent to the quadratic equation:~~[x + (b/2a)]`253` = (b`253` - 4ac)/(4a`253`)~~Taking the square root of both sides, and isolating x, gives:~~x = [-b `241` `251`(b`253` - 4ac)]/2a~~A number of alternative derivations can be found in the literature which either (a) are simpler than the standard completing the square method, (b) represent interesting applications of other frequently used techniques in algebra, or (c) offer insight into other areas of mathematics.~~Reduced quadratic equation:-~=============================~~It is sometimes convenient to reduce a quadratic equation to an equation involving two instead of three constant coefficients. This is done by simply dividing both sides by a, which is possible because a is non-zero. This produces the reduced quadratic equation:~~x`253` + px + q = 0~~Here p = b/a and q = c/a are the only coefficients in the reduced equation, which is also called a monic equation.~~It follows from the quadratic formula that the solution to the reduced quadratic equation is~~x = -p/2 `241` `251`[(p/2)`253` - q]~~Discriminant:-~===============~~In the quadratic formula, the expression underneath the square root sign is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation, and is often represented using an upper case D or an upper case Greek delta:~~`127` = b`253` - 4ac~~A quadratic equation with real coefficients can have either one or two distinct real roots, or two distinct complex roots. In this case the discriminant determines the number and nature of the roots. There are three cases:~~1. If the discriminant is positive, then there are two distinct roots~~[-b `241` `251`(`127`)]/2a~~both of which are real numbers. For quadratic equations with rational coefficients, if the discriminant is a square number, then the roots are rational—in other cases they may be quadratic irrationals.~~2. If the discriminant is zero, then there is exactly one real root~~-b/2a~~sometimes called a repeated or double root.~~3. If the discriminant is negative, then there are no real roots. Rather, there are two distinct (non-real) complex roots~~[-b `241` i`251`(`127`)]/2a~~which are complex conjugates of each other. In these expressions i is the imaginary unit.~~Thus the roots are distinct if and only if the discriminant is non-zero, and the roots are real if and only if the discriminant is non-negative.|http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticEquation.html
QUADRILATERAL#In Euclidean plane geometry, a quadrilateral is a polygon with~four sides (or edges) and four vertices or corners. Sometimes,~the term quadrangle is used, by analogy with triangle, and~sometimes tetragon for consistency with pentagon (5-sided),~hexagon (6-sided) and so on.~~The origin of the word "quadrilateral" is the two Latin words~quadri, a variant of four, and latus, meaning "side."~~Quadrilaterals are simple (not self-intersecting) or complex~(self-intersecting), also called crossed. Simple quadrilaterals~are either convex or concave.~|Properties of Parallelograms:-~===============================~In a parallelogram, ~1. The parallel sides are parallel by definition. ~2. The opposite sides are congruent. ~3. The opposite angles are congruent. ~4. The diagonals bisect each other. ~5. Any pair of consecutive angles are supplementary. ~ ~Properties of Rectangles:-~===========================~In a rectangle, ~1. All the properties of a parallelogram apply by definition. ~2. All angles are right angles. ~3. The diagonals are congruent. ~ ~Properties of Kites:-~======================~In a kite, ~1. Two disjoint pairs of consecutive sides are congruent by~definition. ~2. The diagonals are perpendicular. ~3. One diagonal is the perpendicular bisector of the other. ~4. One of the diagonals bisects a pair of opposite angles. ~5. One pair of opposite angles are congruent. ~ ~Properties of Rhombuses:-~==========================~In a rhombus, ~1. All the properties of a parallelogram apply by definition. ~2. Two consecutive sides are congruent by definition. ~3. All sides are congruent. ~4. The diagonals bisect the angles. ~5. The diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. ~6. The diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right~triangles. ~ ~Properties of Squares:-~========================~In a square, ~1. All the properties of a rectangle apply by definition. ~2. All the properties of a rhombus apply by definition. ~3. The diagonals form four isosceles right triangles. ~ ~Properties of Isosceles Trapezoids:-~=====================================~In an isosceles trapezoid, ~1. The legs are congruent by definition. ~2. The bases are parallel by definition. ~3. The lower base angles are congruent. ~4. The upper base angles are congruent. ~5. The diagonals are congruent. ~6. Any lower base angle is supplementary to any upper base~angle. ~|The area can be expressed in trigonometric terms as~~K = `171`[pq.sin(`224`)]~~where the lengths of the diagonals are p and q and the angle~between them is `224`.~~Bretschneider's formula expresses the area in terms of the~sides and two opposite angles:~~K = `251`[(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)-`171`{abcd(1+cos(A+C))}]~~where the sides in sequence are a, b, c, d, where s is the~semiperimeter, and A and C are two (in fact, any two) opposite~angles. This reduces to Brahmagupta's formula for the area of a ~cyclic quadrilateral when A+C = 180`248`.~~Another area formula in terms of the sides and angles, with~angle C being between sides b and c, and A being between sides~a and d, is~~K = `171`[ad.sin(A)]+`171`[bc.sin(C)]~~Another area formula including the sides a, b, c, d is~~K=`172`{`251`[(2(a`253`+c`253`)-4x`253`)(2(b`253`+d`253`)-4x`253`)]}.sin(`237`)~~where x is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals~and `237` is the angle between the bimedians.~|http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/Quadrilaterals.html
