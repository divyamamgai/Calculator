(4, 'LINEAR EQUATION', 'A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term\r\nis either a constant or the product of a constant and (the\r\nfirst power of) a single variable.\r\n\r\nLinear equations can have one or more variables. Linear\r\nequations occur abundantly in most subareas of mathematics and\r\nespecially in applied mathematics. While they arise quite\r\nnaturally when modeling many phenomena, they are particularly\r\nuseful since many non-linear equations may be reduced to linear\r\nequations by assuming that quantities of interest vary to only\r\na small extent from some "background" state. Linear equations\r\ndo not include exponents.\r\n\r\nThis article considers the case of a single equation for which\r\none searches the real solutions. All its content applies for\r\ncomplex solutions and, more generally for linear equations with\r\ncoefficients and solutions in any field. For coefficients and\r\nsolutions in an integral domain, see Linear equation over a\r\nring.\r\n\r\nIn mathematics, a system of linear equations (or linear system)\r\nis a collection of linear equations involving the same set of\r\nvariables. For example,\r\n\r\n3x + 2y - z = 1\r\n2x - 2y + 4z = -2\r\n-x + `171`y - z = 0\r\n\r\nis a system of three equations in the three variables x, y, z.\r\nA solution to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to\r\nthe variables such that all the equations are simultaneously\r\nsatisfied. A solution to the system above is given by\r\n\r\nx = 1\r\ny = -2\r\nz = -2\r\n\r\nsince it makes all three equations valid. The word "system"\r\nindicates that the equations are to be considered collectively,\r\nrather than individually.', 'System of linear equations:-\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nGeneral form:-\r\n+++++++++++++++\r\nA general system of m linear equations with n unknowns can be\r\nwritten as\r\n\r\na11x1 + a12x2 + .... + a1nxn = b1\r\na21x1 + a22x2 + .... + a2nxn = b2\r\n  .       .              .     .\r\n  .       .              .     .\r\n  .       .              .     .\r\nam1x1 + am2x2 + .... + amnxn = bm\r\n\r\nHere x1,x2,....,xn are the unknowns, a11,a12,...,amn are the\r\ncoefficients of the system, and b1,b2,....,bn are the\r\nconstant terms.\r\n\r\nOften the coefficients and unknowns are real or complex\r\nnumbers, but integers and rational numbers are also seen, as\r\nare polynomials and elements of an abstract algebraic\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nMatrix equation:-\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nAx = b\r\n\r\nwhere A is an m×n matrix, x is a column vector with n\r\nentries, and b is a column vector with m entries.\r\n\r\nA = `179` a11 a12 ... a1n `179`  x = `179` x1 `179`  b = `179` b1 `179`\r\n    `179` a21 a22 ... a2n `179`      `179` x2 `179`      `179` b2 `179`\r\n    `179`  .   .  ...  .  `179`      `179` .  `179`      `179` .  `179`\r\n    `179`  .   .  ...  .  `179`      `179` .  `179`      `179` .  `179`\r\n    `179` a21 a22 ... a2n `179`      `179` xn `179`      `179` bm `179`\r\n\r\nThe number of vectors in a basis for the span is now\r\nexpressed as the rank of the matrix.\r\n\r\nLinear equations in two variables:-\r\n====================================\r\nA common form of a linear equation in the two variables x and y is\r\n\r\ny = mx + b\r\n\r\nwhere m and b designate constants (parameters). The origin of\r\nthe name "linear" comes from the fact that the set of solutions\r\nof such an equation forms a straight line in the plane. In this\r\nparticular equation, the constant m determines the slope or\r\ngradient of that line, and the constant term b determines the\r\npoint at which the line crosses the y-axis, otherwise known as\r\nthe y-intercept.\r\n\r\nForms for 2-D linear equations:-\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nGeneral (or standard) form:-\r\n-----------------------------\r\nIn the general (or standard[1]) form the linear equation is\r\nwritten as:\r\n\r\nAx + By = C\r\n\r\nwhere A and B are not both equal to zero. The equation is\r\nusually written so that A & 0, by convention. The graph of the\r\nequation is a straight line, and every straight line can be\r\nrepresented by an equation in the above form. If A is nonzero,\r\nthen the x-intercept, that is, the x-coordinate of the point\r\nwhere the graph crosses the x-axis (where, y is zero), is C/A.\r\n\r\nIf B is nonzero, then the y-intercept, that is the y-\r\ncoordinate of the point where the graph crosses the y-axis \r\n(where x is zero), is C/B, and the slope of the line is A/B.\r\nThe general form is sometimes written as:\r\n\r\nax + by + c = 0\r\n\r\nwhere a and b are not both equal to zero.\r\nThe two versions can be converted from one to the other by \r\nmoving the constant term to the other side of the equal sign.\r\n\r\nSlope-intercept form:-\r\n-----------------------\r\ny = mx + b\r\n\r\nwhere m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept,\r\nwhich is the y-coordinate of the location where line crosses\r\nthe y axis. This can be seen by letting x = 0, which\r\nimmediately gives y = b. It may be helpful to think about\r\nthis in terms of y = b + mx; where the line passes through\r\nthe point (0, b) and extends to the left and right at a slope\r\nof m. Vertical lines, having undefined slope, cannot be\r\nrepresented by this form.\r\n\r\nPoint-slope form:-\r\n-------------------\r\ny-y1 = m(x-x1)\r\n\r\nwhere m is the slope of the line and (x1,y1) is any point on\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\nThe point-slope form expresses the fact that the difference\r\nin the y coordinate between two points on a line (that is, y-\r\ny1) is proportional to the difference in the x coordinate\r\n(that is, x-x1). The proportionality constant is m (the slope\r\nof the line).\r\n\r\nTwo-point form:-\r\n-----------------\r\ny-y1 = {(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)}(x-x1)\r\n\r\nwhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line with\r\nx2-x1. This is equivalent to the point-slope form above,\r\nwhere the slope is explicitly given as (y2-y1)/(x2-x1).\r\n\r\nIntercept form:-\r\n-----------------\r\nx/a + y/b = 1\r\n\r\nwhere a and b must be nonzero. The graph of the equation has\r\nx-intercept a and y-intercept b. The intercept form is in\r\nstandard form with A/C = 1/a and B/C = 1/b. Lines that pass\r\nthrough the origin or which are horizontal or vertical\r\nviolate the nonzero condition on a or b and cannot be\r\nrepresented in this form.\r\n\r\nParametric form:-\r\n------------------\r\nx = Tt + U\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\ny = Vt + W\r\n\r\nTwo simultaneous equations in terms of a variable parameter\r\nt, with slope m = V / T, x-intercept (VU - WT) / V and y-\r\nintercept (WT - VU) / T. This can also be related to the two-\r\npoint form, where T = p - h, U = h, V = q - k, and W = k:\r\nThis can also be related to the two-point form, where T = p -\r\n h, U = h, V = q - k, and W = k:\r\n\r\nx = (p - h)t + h\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\ny = (q - k)t + k\r\n\r\nIn this case t varies from 0 at point (h,k) to 1 at point\r\n(p,q), with values of t between 0 and 1 providing\r\ninterpolation and other values of t providing extrapolation.\r\n\r\nMatrix form:-\r\n--------------\r\nUsing the order of the standard form\r\n\r\nAx + By = C\r\n\r\none can rewrite the equation in matrix form:\r\n\r\n`179` A B `179` `179` x `179` = `179` C `179`\r\n        `179` y `179`\r\n\r\nFurther, this representation extends to systems of linear equations.\r\n\r\nA1x + B1y = C1\r\nA2x + B2y = C2\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n`179` A1 B1 `179` `179` x `179` = `179` C1 `179`\r\n`179` A2 B2 `179` `179` y `179` = `179` C2 `179`\r\n\r\nSince this extends easily to higher dimensions, it is a\r\ncommon representation in linear algebra, and in computer\r\nprogramming. There are named methods for solving system of\r\nlinear equations, like Gauss-Jordan which can be expressed as \r\nmatrix elementary row operations.', 'No Info. available here, please view other sections to get information.', 'http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LinearEquation.html'),

A regular hexagon has 6 rotational symmetries (rotational symmetry of order six) and 6 reflection symmetries (six lines of symmetry), making up the dihedral group D6. The longest diagonals of a regular hexagon, connecting diametrically opposite vertices, are twice the length of one side. From this it can be seen that a triangle with a vertex at the center of the regular hexagon and sharing one side with the hexagon is equilateral, and that the regular hexagon can be partitioned into six equilateral triangles.\r\n\r\nLike squares and equilateral triangles, regular hexagons fit together without any gaps to tile the plane (three hexagons meeting at every vertex), and so are useful for constructing tessellations. The cells of a beehive honeycomb are hexagonal for this reason and because the shape makes efficient use of space and building materials. The Voronoi diagram of a regular triangular lattice is the honeycomb tessellation of hexagons.

(16620, 'TRIANGLE', 'A triangle is one of the basic shapes in geometry: a polygon\r\nwith three corners or vertices and three sides or edges which\r\nare line segments. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is\r\ndenoted `30` ABC.\r\n\r\nIn Euclidean geometry any three points, when non-collinear,\r\ndetermine a unique triangle and a unique plane (i.e. a \r\ntwo-dimensional Euclidean space).\r\n\r\nTypes of triangle:-\r\n====================\r\n\r\nBy relative lengths of sides:-\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nTriangles can be classified according to the relative lengths of their sides:\r\n\r\n1. In an equilateral triangle all sides have the same length. An\r\nequilateral triangle is also a regular polygon with all angles\r\nmeasuring 60`248`.\r\n\r\n2. In an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal in length. An\r\nisosceles triangle also has two angles of the same measure;\r\nnamely, the angles opposite to the two sides of the same\r\nlength; this fact is the content of the isosceles triangle\r\ntheorem, which was known by Euclid. Some mathematicians define an isosceles triangle to have exactly two equal sides, whereas others define\r\nan isosceles triangle as one with at least two equal sides. The latter definition would make all equilateral triangles isosceles triangles. The 45-45-90 right triangle, which appears in the tetrakis square tiling, is isosceles.\r\n\r\n3. In a scalene triangle, all sides are unequal, and\r\nequivalently all angles are unequal. Right triangles are\r\nscalene if and only if not isosceles.\r\n\r\nBy internal angles:-\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nTriangles can also be classified according to their internal angles (measured here in degrees):-\r\n\r\n1. A right triangle (or right-angled triangle, formerly\r\ncalled a rectangled triangle) has one of its interior angles measuring 90`248` (a right angle). The side opposite to the right angle is the hypotenuse; it is the longest side of the right triangle. The other two sides\r\nare called the legs or catheti (singular: cathetus) of the triangle. Right triangles obey the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse: \r\n\r\na`253` + b`253` = c`253` \r\n\r\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length\r\nof the hypotenuse. Special right triangles are right\r\ntriangles with additional properties that make calculations\r\ninvolving them easier. One of the two most famous is the \r\n3-4-5 right triangle, where 3`253` + 4`253` = 5`253`. In this\r\nsituation, 3, 4, and 5 are a Pythagorean triple. The other\r\none is an isosceles triangle that has 2 angles that each\r\nmeasure 45 degrees.\r\n\r\n2. Triangles that do not have an angle that measures 90`248` are called oblique triangles.\r\n\r\n3. A triangle that has all interior angles measuring less\r\nthan 90`248` is an acute triangle or acute-angled triangle. If the greatest side length is c, then a`253` + b`253` > c`253`.\r\n\r\n4. A triangle that has one interior angle that measures more\r\nthan 90`248` is an obtuse triangle or obtuse-angled triangle. If the greatest side length is c, then a`253` + b`253` < c`253`.\r\n\r\n5. A "triangle" with an interior angle of 180`248` (and collinear vertices) is degenerate.\r\n\r\n6. A right degenerate triangle has collinear vertices, two of\r\nwhich are coincident.\r\n', 'Triangles are assumed to be two-dimensional plane figures, unless the context provides otherwise (see Non-planar triangles, below). In rigorous treatments, a triangle is therefore called a 2-simplex (see also Polytope). Elementary facts about triangles were presented by Euclid in books 1-4 of his Elements, around 300 BC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe measures of the interior angles of the triangle always add up to 180 degrees (same color to point out they are equal).\r\nThe measures of the interior angles of a triangle in Euclidean space always add up to 180 degrees. This allows determination of the measure of the third angle of any triangle given the measure of two angles. An exterior angle of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it; this is the exterior angle theorem. The sum of the measures of the three exterior angles (one for each vertex) of any triangle is 360 degrees.\r\n\r\nSimilarity and congruence:-\r\n============================\r\n\r\nTwo triangles are said to be similar if every angle of one triangle has the same measure as the corresponding angle in the other triangle. The corresponding sides of similar triangles have lengths that are in the same proportion, and this property is also sufficient to establish similarity.\r\nA few basic theorems about similar triangles:\r\n\r\n1. If two corresponding internal angles of two triangles have the same measure, the triangles are similar.\r\n\r\n2. If two corresponding sides of two triangles are in proportion, and their included angles have the same measure, then the triangles are similar. (The included angle for any two sides of a polygon is the internal angle between those two sides.)\r\n\r\n3. If three corresponding sides of two triangles are in proportion, then the triangles are similar.\r\n\r\nTwo triangles that are congruent have exactly the same size and shape: all pairs of corresponding interior angles are equal in measure, and all pairs of corresponding sides have the same length. (This is a total of six equalities, but three are often sufficient to prove congruence.)\r\n\r\nSome sufficient conditions for a pair of triangles to be congruent are:+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\nSAS Postulate: Two sides in a triangle have the same length as two sides in the other triangle, and the included angles have the same measure.\r\n\r\nASA: Two interior angles and the included side in a triangle have the same measure and length, respectively, as those in the other triangle. (The included side for a pair of angles is the side that is common to them.)\r\n\r\nSSS: Each side of a triangle has the same length as a corresponding side of the other triangle.\r\n\r\nAAS: Two angles and a corresponding (non-included) side in a triangle have the same measure and length, respectively, as those in the other triangle. (This is sometimes referred to as AAcorrS and then includes ASA above.)\r\n\r\nHypotenuse-Leg (HL) Theorem: The hypotenuse and a leg in a right triangle have the same length as those in another right triangle. This is also called RHS (right-angle, hypotenuse, side).\r\n\r\nHypotenuse-Angle Theorem: The hypotenuse and an acute angle in one right triangle have the same length and measure, respectively, as those in the other right triangle. This is just a particular case of the AAS theorem.\r\n\r\nAn important case:\r\n\r\nSide-Side-Angle (or Angle-Side-Side) condition: If two sides and a corresponding non-included angle of a triangle have the same length and measure, respectively, as those in another triangle, then this is not sufficient to prove congruence; but if the angle given is opposite to the longer side of the two sides, then the triangles are congruent. The Hypotenuse-Leg Theorem is a particular case of this criterion. The Side-Side-Angle condition does not by itself guarantee that the triangles are congruent because one triangle could be obtuse-angled and the other acute-angled.\r\n\r\nUsing right triangles and the concept of similarity, the trigonometric functions sine and cosine can be defined. These are functions of an angle which are investigated in trigonometry.\r\n\r\nExistence of a triangle:-\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nThe sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side, a principle known as the triangle inequality. Since the vertices of a triangle are assumed to be non-collinear, it is not possible for the sum of the length of two sides be equal to the length of the third side; nor is it possible for that sum to be less than the length of the third side.\r\n\r\nTrigonometric conditions:-\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nThree positive angles `224`, `225`, and `231`, each of them less than 180`248`, are the angles of a triangle if and only if any one of the following conditions holds:\r\n\r\ntan(`224`/2)tan(`225`/2) + tan(`225`/2)tan(`231`/2) + tan(`231`/2)tan(`224`/2) = 1\r\n\r\nsin`253`(`224`/2) + sin`253`(`225`/2) + sin`253`(`231`/2) + 2sin(`224`/2)sin(`225`/2)sin(`231`/2) = 1\r\n', 'Sine, cosine and tangent rules:-\r\n=================================\r\n\r\nThe law of sines, or sine rule, states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its corresponding opposite angle is constant, that is\r\n\r\na/sin(`224`) = b/sin(`225`) = c/sin(`231`)\r\n\r\nThis ratio is equal to the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the given triangle. Another interpretation of this theorem is that every triangle with angles `224`, `225` and `231` is similar to a triangle with side lengths equal to sin(`224`), sin(`225`) and sin(`231`). This triangle can be constructed by first constructing a circle of diameter 1, and inscribing in it two of the angles of the triangle. The length of the sides of that triangle will be sin(`224`), sin(`225`) and sin(`231`). The side whose length is sin(`224`) is opposite to the angle whose measure is (`224`), etc.\r\n\r\nThe law of cosines, or cosine rule, connects the length of an unknown side of a triangle to the length of the other sides and the angle opposite to the unknown side. As per the law:\r\nFor a triangle with length of sides a, b, c and angles of `224`, `225` and `231` respectively, given two known lengths of a triangle a and b, and the angle between the two known sides `231` (or the angle opposite to the unknown side c), to calculate the third side c, the following formula can be used:\r\n\r\nc`253` = a`253` + b`253` -2abcos(`231`)\r\n\r\nb`253` = a`253` + c`253` -2accos(`225`)\r\n\r\na`253` = b`253` + c`253` -2bccos(`224`)\r\n\r\nThe law of tangents or tangent rule, can be used to find a side or an angle when you know two sides and an angle or two angles and a side. It states that:\r\n\r\n(a - b)/(a + b) = tan[{`171`(`224`-`225`)}/{`171`(`224`+`225`)}]\r\n\r\nComputing the area of a triangle:-\r\n===================================\r\n\r\nCalculating the area T of a triangle is an elementary problem encountered often in many different situations. The best known and simplest formula is:\r\n\r\nT = `171`(bh)\r\n\r\nwhere b is the length of the base of the triangle, and h is the height or altitude of the triangle. The term "base" denotes any side, and "height" denotes the length of a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the side onto the line containing the side itself. In 499 CE Aryabhata, a great mathematician-astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy, used this method in the Aryabhatiya (section 2.6).', 'http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/Triangles.html'),
(32359, 'QUADRATIC EQUATION', 'In elementary algebra, a quadratic equation (from the Latin quadratus for "square") is any equation having the form\r\n\r\nax`253` + bx + c = 0\r\n\r\nwhere x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c are constants with a not equal to 0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic. The constants a, b, and c are called, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term.\r\n\r\nBecause the quadratic equation involves only one unknown, it is called "univariate". The quadratic equation only contains powers of x that are non-negative integers, and therefore it is a polynomial equation, and in particular it is a second degree polynomial equation since the greatest power is two.', 'Solving the quadratic equation:-\r\n=================================\r\n\r\nA quadratic equation with real or complex coefficients has two solutions, called roots. These two solutions may or may not be distinct, and they may or may not be real.\r\n\r\nFactoring by inspection:-\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to express a quadratic equation, ax`253` + bx + c = 0 as a product (px + q)(rx + s) = 0. In some cases, it is possible, by simple inspection, to determine values of p, q, r, and s that make the two forms equivalent to one another. If the quadratic equation is written in the second form, then the "Zero Factor Property" states that the quadratic equation is satisfied if px + q = 0 or rx + s = 0. Solving these two linear equations provides the roots of the quadratic.\r\n\r\nFor most students, factoring by inspection is the first method of solving quadratic equations to which they are exposed. If one is given a quadratic equation in the form x2 + px + q = 0, one would seek to find two numbers that add up to p and whose product is q ("Vieta''s Rule"). The more general case where a does not equal 1 can require a considerable effort in trial and error guess-and-check, assuming that it can be factored at all by inspection.\r\n\r\nExcept for special cases such as where b = 0 or c = 0, factoring by inspection only works for quadratic equations that have rational roots. This means that the great majority of quadratic equations that arise in practical applications cannot be solved by factoring by inspection.\r\n\r\nCompleting the square:-\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nThe process of completing the square makes use of the algebraic identity\r\n\r\nx`253` + 2xh + h`253` = (x+h)`253`,\r\n\r\nwhich represents a well-defined algorithm that can be used to solve any quadratic equation. Starting with a quadratic equation in standard form, ax`253` + bx + c = 0\r\n\r\nDivide each side by a, the coefficient of the squared term.\r\nRearrange the equation so that the constant term c/a is on the right side.\r\n\r\nAdd the square of one-half of b/a, the coefficient of x, to both sides. This "completes the square", converting the left side into a perfect square.\r\n\r\nWrite the left side as a square and simplify the right side if necessary.\r\n\r\nProduce two linear equations by equating the square root of the left side with the positive and negative square roots of the right side.\r\n\r\nSolve the two linear equations.\r\n\r\n', 'Quadratic formula and its derivation:-\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nCompleting the square can be used to derive a general formula for solving quadratic equations, called the quadratic formula.  The mathematical proof will now be briefly summarized.[4] It can easily be seen, by polynomial expansion, that the following equation is equivalent to the quadratic equation:\r\n\r\n[x + (b/2a)]`253` = (b`253` - 4ac)/(4a`253`)\r\n\r\nTaking the square root of both sides, and isolating x, gives:\r\n\r\nx = [-b `241` `251`(b`253` - 4ac)]/2a\r\n\r\nA number of alternative derivations can be found in the literature which either (a) are simpler than the standard completing the square method, (b) represent interesting applications of other frequently used techniques in algebra, or (c) offer insight into other areas of mathematics.\r\n\r\nReduced quadratic equation:-\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes convenient to reduce a quadratic equation to an equation involving two instead of three constant coefficients. This is done by simply dividing both sides by a, which is possible because a is non-zero. This produces the reduced quadratic equation:\r\n\r\nx`253` + px + q = 0\r\n\r\nHere p = b/a and q = c/a are the only coefficients in the reduced equation, which is also called a monic equation.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the quadratic formula that the solution to the reduced quadratic equation is\r\n\r\nx = -p/2 `241` `251`[(p/2)`253` - q]\r\n\r\nDiscriminant:-\r\n===============\r\n\r\nIn the quadratic formula, the expression underneath the square root sign is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation, and is often represented using an upper case D or an upper case Greek delta:\r\n\r\n`127` = b`253` - 4ac\r\n\r\nA quadratic equation with real coefficients can have either one or two distinct real roots, or two distinct complex roots. In this case the discriminant determines the number and nature of the roots. There are three cases:\r\n\r\n1. If the discriminant is positive, then there are two distinct roots\r\n\r\n[-b `241` `251`(`127`)]/2a\r\n\r\nboth of which are real numbers. For quadratic equations with rational coefficients, if the discriminant is a square number, then the roots are rational—in other cases they may be quadratic irrationals.\r\n\r\n2. If the discriminant is zero, then there is exactly one real root\r\n\r\n-b/2a\r\n\r\nsometimes called a repeated or double root.\r\n\r\n3. If the discriminant is negative, then there are no real roots. Rather, there are two distinct (non-real) complex roots\r\n\r\n[-b `241` i`251`(`127`)]/2a\r\n\r\nwhich are complex conjugates of each other. In these expressions i is the imaginary unit.\r\n\r\nThus the roots are distinct if and only if the discriminant is non-zero, and the roots are real if and only if the discriminant is non-negative.', 'http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticEquation.html'),
